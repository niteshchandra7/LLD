Low Level Design

# Gamma Categorization

# Design Patterns are typically split into three categories.

# Creational Patterns
##  -   Deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
##  -   Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit. (DI, reflections, etc.)
##  -   Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise. (step-by-step)

# Structural Patterns
##  -   Concerned with the structure. (eg, class memebers)
##  -   Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
##  -   Stress the importance of good API design.

# Behavioral Patterns
##  -   They are all different; no central theme.
