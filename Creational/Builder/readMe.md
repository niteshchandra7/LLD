Builder Design patterns

# Motivation

#   -   Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call.
#   -   Other objects require a lot of ceremony to happen.
#   -   Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive.

#   When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it
#   succintly.
